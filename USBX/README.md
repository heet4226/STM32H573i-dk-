This program file is used for the direct implementation of a middleware component from ThreadX, namely USBX, configured as a USB Mass Storage Device (MSC). Using this code, the STM32H573I-DK board enumerates as a mass storage device when connected to a host computer, allowing it to appear and operate like a standard USB storage device.

Note: Only the code written within the USER CODE BEGIN / USER CODE END sections was developed by me. All other code is provided by the STM32 Board Support Package (BSP) and/or associated libraries, and is not claimed as my own work.
