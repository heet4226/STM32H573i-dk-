The repository STM32H573i-DK contains example projects for nearly all peripherals available on the board, using the official ST middleware packages. It also includes clear view on where each file should be placed within the project structure, which is especially helpful for more complex peripherals such as USB and Ethernet. This makes the repository a valuable reference for learning and correctly integrating these features.
